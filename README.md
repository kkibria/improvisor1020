Planning to do some experiments. The idea is to get rid of the Java runtime dependency.

## Stage 1
* User interface with html-javascript-css technology. svelte will be my preference because of its small
footprint.
* Program logic converted to javascript to bundle with Electron. I will try to use transpilers j2cl is
my preference as it has been road tested by many others.
## Stage 2
* Program logic converted to golang to bundle with webview. godzilla is a feature incomplete
transpiler that can be used. This stage may have to wait for a mature transpiler.

Goal is to learn how to do music/sound/DAW applications with html-javascript-css technology based
user interface with native binary backend.
